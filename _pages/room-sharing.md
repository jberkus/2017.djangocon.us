  Do you want to share a room at the venue with other attendees, have accommodation available, or want to share a ride from nearby cities?
---

Do you want to share a room at the [venue](/venue/#welcome) (Hotel RL by Red Lion Spokane at the Park) with other attendees, or have accommodation available? Do you want to drive to DjangoCon from Portland, Seattle, Boise, or other nearby cities?

We have a [Google Spreadsheet just for you!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xol19ghdCMiU9bID9bkd39suw4bES_hGfr2-dYOcTOM/edit?usp=sharing) 

If you're looking for a room, list yourself along with:

- How many other people you want to share with
- What nights you'll be there
- Whether you've already reserved a room
- Any other requirements (e.g. man/woman, smoking/non, snoring/non, etc)

If you're looking for or giving a ride, list yourself along with the dates you're travelling and where you're coming from

**Note:** _If any of your roommates will be arriving separately, be sure to list their names on the reservation as having permission to check in and get a key to your shared room from the front desk by showing photo ID._

_When reserving your room, be sure to specify the type and number of beds! Some rooms only have a single king size bed; not ideal for platonic room sharing._

**Caution:** Room and ride sharing arrangements are the responsibilities of the individual parties involved. DEFNA, DSF, and DjangoCon US Staff takes no responsibility, and cannot be involved in any disputes.
